# A source code library with C++ intrusive lists utilities

## Overview

This **open source** project provides the **source code** for a library
that implements **C++ intrusive double linked lists**,
a special class of lists that store the links inside the listed objects,
in order to avoid dynamic memory allocations, a useful feature in embedded
systems.

## [Project documentation](https://micro-os-plus.github.io/utils-lists-xpack/)

For information on how to install and use this library, please refer to the
