# A source code library with C++ intrusive lists utilities

## Overview

systems.

## Git repo

The **open source** project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack).

## Web site

The project documentation is available online via GitHub
