# A source code library with the µOS++ C++ intrusive lists

## Overview

This project provides the **source code** for a library
that implements the **µOS++ C++ intrusive double linked lists**.
These are special lists that avoid dynamic memory allocations by
storing the links inside the list elements. This is particularly
useful in embedded systems.

## [Project documentation](https://micro-os-plus.github.io/utils-lists-xpack/)

For information on how to install and use this library, please refer to the
[project documentation](https://micro-os-plus.github.io/utils-lists-xpack/) web site.
